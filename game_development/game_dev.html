			<h3>Shadow v2</h3>
			<p>
				I recently found unfinished or partially finished game projects in my dropbox. Many of these are unfinished projects which served to demonstrate my ability to code. However, one of these I considered finished.
			</p>
			<p>
				Shadow v2 was the final game I developed alone for Advanced Game Design during my sophomore year of high school. Developed in Game Maker 8, a free video game engine for beginners, most of the objects could be created with drag and drop code via ~70 premade actions, but I opted to code with Game Maker Language (GML) scripts if more than 3 actions were needed. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/cicj19g3640h75j8p7x23/AB0r-AR6P6LvKp0QGcCOGnM?rlkey=9j8ctoofpdz5ev483dtsxn9ra&st=c6h3ib4f&dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is a link to my dropbox to download and play the executable.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this game the objective is to navigate each level without entering any <i>light</i> and <i>delluminate</i> all torches to expose stairs to ascend to the next level. The player can shoot <i>shadows</i> at the torches to interact with them. There are three variants of torches: yellow, red, and blue.
				<ul>
					<li>Yellow torches are surrounded by lights which disappear when unlit</li>
					<li>Red torches come in pairs and relight shortly after becoming unlit unless both are unlit together</li>
					<li>Blue torches when unlit empower <i>shadows</i> to destroy lights</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Through the initial project I demonstrated my comfort in GML with sprites, animation, collisions, timed events, and basic coding. The Game Maker project from 2014 (*.gmk file) could not be played without expired software and only included 3 playable levels. So, I decided to add 5 levels to better showcase the game mechanics before compiling the project into an executable file.

			<h3>Fishing Game</h3>
			<p>
				Stepping aside from the below Dungeon Delve project, I am working on a smaller scope project to submit to Potions & Pixels One Button Contest Game Jam. The theme of this Game Jam is to complete a game with only one assigned input for the game, and it is limited to participants local to the area. I am working on the core gameplay loop while my brother works on modelling, animations and visuals. The guidelines for the Game Jam are as follows
				<ul>
					<li>One dedicated button used for all input (excluding non-gameplay menus)</li>
					<li>Participation limited to residents within greater Charlotte metropolitan area</li>
					<li>Submission must be uploaded to <a href="https://itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itch.io</a></li>
				</ul>
				My submission will be a fishing game with all inputs bound to <em>spacebar</em>. The player will cast a line in a body of water targeting fish, then completing a fishing minigame to <em>catch</em> the fish until all fish are removed from the body of water.
			</p>
			<p>
				Below highlights a quick prototype of the line casting game logic with a <em>direction</em> and <em>strength</em> progress bar to compute a fishing location using trigonometry.

			<h3>Dungeon Delve</h3>
			<p>
				I am currently learning how to use Unreal Engine through developing a game. I plan to create a cooperative PvE extraction rpg where you descend a dungeon to higher difficulties before resurfacing. For my first milestone, I am planning to have 5 distinct enemy archetypes with basic AI, combat, 1 boss fight, 5 different themed levels, and an extraction system. Through creating this game, I hope to learn the basics of the 3D game engine to understand where my strengths, limits and weaknesses lie. So far, I have created
				<ul>
					<li>Rigged basic 3d objects as enemies and weapons</li>
					<li>Custom animations for enemies and weapons</li>
					<li>Basic enemy AI using player data</li>
					<li>Four levels connected by <i>stairs</i> objects</li>
					<li>Health UI and Damage logic for player and enemies</li>
				</ul>
				I consider the next steps towards completion to be my weak points, and I expect research and execution going forward will broaden my horizons of how I view development in Unreal:
				<ul>
					<li>Sound effects</li>
					<li>Background music</li>
					<li>Collisions and physics (combat, movement)</li>
					<li>GUIs</li>
					<li>Lighting</li>
					<li>Enemy AI that interacts with level design</li>
				</ul>
